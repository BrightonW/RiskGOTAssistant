GAIN AND LOSS OF TERRITORIES

To manage taking of territories: After each turn record the losses and gains of 
    territories relevant to you. The system we use is the 3-letter code, 
    which is often the first three letters of the name of the territory except when
    the first word is 'the'. Another special case is the Dothraki Sea territories,
    for west,east and south Dothraki Sea, input 'w'/'e'/'s' and then 'do' for 'Dothraki'

For gain of territories: w xyz,... (3-letter territory code)            
For loss of territories: l xyz,... (3-letter territory code)         

The examples denote the gains of territories lys and volantis as well as
    the losses of tyr and myr
